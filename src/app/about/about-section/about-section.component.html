                <div class="card-body">
                  <p class="card-text">As a Software Engineer, I worked with a team of talented developers to deliver high-quality software products that meet the needs of our clients and users. I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science from PSG College of Technology, where I learned the fundamentals of programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. I have also completed multiple certifications in Full stack java development, Angular, Docker, and Kubernetes, which demonstrate my skills and competencies in developing and deploying web applications using modern technologies and frameworks. I have over two years of work experience as a Software Engineer at Software AG, where I started as an Internship Trainee and progressed to Software Engineer I and then Software Engineer II. During this time, I have contributed to various micro-services, API development, and user interface design, using my skills such as Core Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and Git. I have also collaborated with other engineers, testers, and clients to ensure the quality, functionality, and usability of our software products. I am passionate about learning new technologies, solving complex problems, and creating innovative solutions that make a positive impact on the world. I am looking for opportunities to further develop my skills and competencies, and to work on challenging and meaningful projects that align with my values and goals.</p>
